  description: >
    Dumbarton is a jekyll theme designed for academics. It is the theme that powers this site.
    It provides enough content to fully represent a full body of work but still retains a minimalistic feel. 
    The theme features a central homepage with easy access to publications, projects, courses, 
    and projects in a single interactive card.
