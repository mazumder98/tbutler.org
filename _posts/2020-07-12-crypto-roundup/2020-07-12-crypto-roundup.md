##### Tether Blacklists 39 Ethereum Addresses Worth Over $46 Million

Just after 100,000 in USDC were blacklisted by Centre, Tether blacklists 46 million Tether in Ethereum addresses.Tether (USDT) has blacklisted 39 Ethereum addresses worth $46 million in USDT, with 24 holding a total of over 5.5 million USDT being blacklisted this year. This revelation comes on the back of Centre’s first blacklisting of an Ethereum address holding $100,000 USDC.

Ethereum researcher at Horizon Games Philippe Castonguay used Dune Analytics to create a dashboard that tracks the number of addresses blacklisted by both Centre and Tether. The largest address holds over 4.5 million USDT and was only recently blacklisted on April 5.

Similar to blacklisted addresses holding USDC, Tether addresses that receive a blacklisting function are no longer able to transact with Tether, freezing any existing coins held in the address. 

General counsel at Bitfinex (sister company of Tether) Stuart Hoegner told the media that Tether works with international law enforcement agencies and blacklists addresses when required:

"Tether routinely assists law enforcement in their investigations... Through the freeze address feature, Tether has been able to help users and exchanges to save and recover tens of millions of dollars stolen from them by hackers."

The archive was reportedly available for everyone to download 
According to an investigation published by Russian language media outlet Meduza, an archive titled “degvoter.zip”, which contains said data, was publicly available for download for at least several hours on July 1 via a government website. The file has since been distributed through various Telegram groups and channels. 

The archive was password protected. According to the publication, however, it could be easily hacked with a free password cracking tool.

The Chinese police busted a massive crypto scam in Wenzhou that managed to amass over $14.31 million.The Chinese authorities dismantled a significant crypto-related scam in Wenzhou. The scheme amassed over 100 million yuan ($14.31 million), which was seized along with a number of luxury cars and villas.

According to Toutiao, the gang has been operating since 2019 and primarily sought out victims through Telegram chat groups, including one called “Huobi Global Moving Brick Arbitrage HT Chinese Group Community.”

ETH, BTC, and USDT stolen from victims
The report states the scammers pretended to be investors who had benefited from an “investment scheme.”

The scammers told their victims that all they had to do was send their cryptos to a fake Huobi wallet address, and the “investor” would receive a more substantial amount in Huobi Token (HT) in return. Instead, they received a fake HT link.

Mo Li, the head of marketing at HashKey Hub, said through a tweet that Chinese police had seized “tens of thousands” of Ether (ETH), Bitcoin (BTC), and Tether (USDT).
